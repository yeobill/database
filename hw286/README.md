# CS286 Homework, Fall 2017: SQL Query Optimizer in SQL
In this assignment, you will build a SQL optimizer in SQL. This is an example of a [self-hosting compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_compiler_construction#Self-hosting_compilers).

**Due date:** This homework is due at 11:59PM on Sunday 12/3. We encourage you to finish by then, and use the following week for studying. However we are offering a no-penalty extension until 11:59PM Saturday 12/9 for those who need extra time.

*You are encouraged to work in pairs on this homework*, but I will accept individual submissions as well.

We have abstracted away some of the fussy details for you:
  - Input: We are not expecting you to parse an SQL query; we assume the query is already described as a set of relational metadata.
  - Output: We are not expecting you to translate the symbolic query plan into something that can be executed; your chosen plan will be represented via a set of relational metadata that can be parsed into a physical query plan for a query executor.
    
We have given you a [skeleton schema for the optimizer state](img/metaschema.png), though you may need to extend it with additional views and tables.

Your job will be to:
  1. Write queries in SQL to populate the summary statistics for the optimizer.
  2. Complete the design of a schema to hold the state of Selinger's dynamic programming algorithm.
  3. Implement Selinger's dynamic programming algorithm using SQL
  4. Make sure your output is in a target schema that can be visualized in the provided [Vega3](https://github.com/vega/vega) visualization spec.
    
## Setup: Getting Started

You should only have to run the commands in this README once.

### Install Pip, Jupyter Notebook support on your VM
Our class VM does not include the Python libraries we need to run Jupyter notebooks, so we will install them by hand.  

To get `pip` and `jupyter` installed, please follow the instructions at [this website](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-jupyter-notebook-to-run-ipython-on-ubuntu-16-04), Steps 1-3.

### Install Postgres support for Jupyter on your VM
In a bash shell with your favorite Python environment loaded, add the `psycopg2` package to make connections to postgres, and the very handy [`ipython-sql`] package (https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql) to integrate SQL queries into Jupyter notebooks.

```bash
% sudo pip install psycopg2
% sudo pip install ipython-sql
```

You will want to refer to the `ipython-sql` documentation for information on:
- How to create a notebook cell that is all in SQL, using the `%%sql` heading.
- How to embed a line of SQL within python using the `%sql` line header.
- How to pass variables into a `%sql` line using the `$` and `:` prefixes.

### Set up Jupyter support for Vega 3
In the same bash shell, we add support for the latest version of the [Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega) visualization library so we can see our plan trees in the notebook.  (Thanks to [@domoritz](https://www.domoritz.de/) for releasing this to us early!)

```bash
% sudo pip install pandas vega3
% sudo pip install --upgrade notebook  # need jupyter_client >= 4.2 for sys-prefix below
% sudo jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py vega3
% sudo jupyter nbextension enable vega3 --py --sys-prefix
```

## Creating the Database
You will need to create a database called `optimizer` for this assignment:
```bash
% createdb optimizer
```

## The Notebook
You should not be ready to do the rest of the homework, which is in [this Jupyter notebook](sqloptimizer.ipynb).  You can view it on github, but to interact with it you need to get back into the VM and run jupyter:

```bash
% jupyter notebook sqloptimizer.ipynb
```

## Working with psql
While debugging, you may want to connect to your database using psql rather than the jupyter notebook. If so, you can connect like this:
```bash
% psql -d optimizer
psql (9.6.5)
Type "help" for help.

optimizer=#
```
Or equivalently, you can switch databases while inside of psql using the `\c` command:
```
% psql
psql (9.6.5)
Type "help" for help.

vagrant=# \c optimizer
You are now connected to database "optimizer" as user "jmh".
optimizer=# 
```

# Getting git set up
First, open up Virtual Box and power on the CS186 virtual machine. Once the machine is booted up, open a terminal and go to the course-projects folder you created in hw0.

```bash
$ cd course-projects
```

Make sure that you switch to the master branch:
```
$ git checkout master
```

It is good practice to run git status to make sure that you haven't inadvertently changed anything in the master branch. Now, you want to add the reference to the staff repository so you call pull the new homework files:
```
$ git fetch staff master
$ git merge staff/master master
```
The git merge will give you a warning and a merge prompt if you have made any conflicting changes to master.

As with hw1, hw2, hw3, hw4, and hw5 make sure you create a new branch for your work:
```
git checkout -b hw286
```
Now, you should be ready to start the homework. Don't forget to push to this branch when you are done with everything!

# Testing and Grades
As this is a graduate assignment, you are expected to develop your own tests. You can consider unit-testing your cost and selectivity formulae. You may want to try a wider variety of different schemas and queries. You can also disable various join methods or costs and see how that affects your outputs.

We will grade this assignment *qualitatively* with a letter grade. Selecting `Run All` from the `Cell` menu of the notebook must produce a good plan for the query given in the notebook, with reasonable cost and size estimates. We may also try some other queries, and see how your chosen plans and cost estimates compare to ours. We will also read over your code.

## Extra credit: incremental visualization
The [visualization notebook](visualizer.ipynb) included provides some Vega3 code for visualizing a single plan tree. It would be much more useful to be able to visualize all the subtrees searched during dynamic programming. One obvious improvement would be to use Vega's [`group` marks](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/marks/group/) to show many subgraphs in a grid, something like in [this example visualization](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/brushing-scatter-plots/).

Extra credit of 5% *for the semester final grade* is available if you visualize the plan space in ways that could be useful to future students in understanding query optimization.

# Inspiration & References
This homework is based on three earlier efforts of interest:
- Most directly, on [Evita Raced](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16501830913872386516&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5), a self-hosted compiler for Datalog, which is an extended relational language. This homework is essentially a subset of Evita Raced, implemented in SQL rather than Datalog.
